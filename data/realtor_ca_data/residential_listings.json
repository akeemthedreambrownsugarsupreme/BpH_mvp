We raised two daughters and found we had enough space to be more than comfortable. We also found it to be soundly built. When doing upgrades, our tendency was to choose low maintenance designs and materials. Eg, high quality flooring, roofing, insulation. The kitchen cupboards are laminate to reduce cleaning work, and they go all the way to the ceiling to avoid dusting on top. That also provides more space for storage. The main bathroom tub surround is one piece of laminate to avoid grouting. Furnace is high efficiency. Windows are low maintenance triple pane with vinyl frames.
